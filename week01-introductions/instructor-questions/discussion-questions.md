# Week 1 Instructor Discussion Questions
## Two Collaboration Models: Hierarchies vs. Open Source

Use these questions to guide Socratic discussion of the two book introductions. Select 4-6 questions based on student engagement and time available.

---

## Theme 1: Authority and Power Dynamics

### Question 1: Sources of Power
**HYBHY** says your manager "has the most influence over your career" in hierarchical organizations. **ProducingOSS** says successful projects need to convince contributors "to work together despite never meeting face-to-face" without formal authority.

**Discussion:** How does the source of authority differ between these two models? What replaces formal power in open source projects?

### Question 2: When Authority Fails
In open source, **ProducingOSS** notes that "dissatisfied contributors simply leave" - traditional management approaches fail.

**Discussion:** Can employees in hierarchical organizations also "just leave"? What constraints prevent that? How does this difference affect the behavior of leaders in each model?

---

## Theme 2: Motivation and Contribution

### Question 3: Why People Contribute
**HYBHY** is about "getting what you want in your career" through working with managers. **ProducingOSS** emphasizes that connection should be "proportional to contributions" in volunteer communities.

**Discussion:** What motivates people in each environment? Are there similarities between why professionals stay engaged at work and why developers contribute to open source?

### Question 4: Meritocracy vs. Hierarchy
**ProducingOSS** advocates for meritocracy where influence grows with contributions. **HYBHY** acknowledges that in hierarchies, "what you want isn't always the same as what your manager wants."

**Discussion:** Can merit-based recognition exist within corporate hierarchies? What happens when contribution doesn't equal recognition in either model?

---

## Theme 3: Communication and Collaboration

### Question 5: Asynchronous vs. Face-to-Face
**ProducingOSS** describes distributed teams who never meet face-to-face. **HYBHY** focuses on direct relationships with your line manager.

**Discussion:** What advantages does each communication style offer? What challenges? As remote work becomes more common, are corporate settings becoming more like open source collaboration?

### Question 6: Transparency and Information Flow
**ProducingOSS** says "first impressions matter" and emphasizes transparent documentation. **HYBHY** will explore (in later chapters) navigating chain of command and information flow in hierarchies.

**Discussion:** How does information transparency differ between these models? Where do you expect more or less transparency in each environment?

---

## Theme 4: Conflict and Differing Agendas

### Question 7: Inevitable Conflict
**HYBHY** states that "everyone in a company is working toward a common goal" but "specifics of what your manager wants isn't always the same as what you want."

**Discussion:** Do open source projects also have "differing agendas" even without formal hierarchies? What kinds of conflicts arise when there's no boss to make final decisions?

### Question 8: Loyalty and Obligation
**HYBHY** will address loyalty in later chapters (Ch 3). **ProducingOSS** emphasizes "culture of choice rather than obligation."

**Discussion:** How is loyalty different in volunteer communities vs. paid employment? Can you be "loyal" to an open source project? What does that look like?

---

## Theme 5: Career Development and Growth

### Question 9: Professional Growth
**HYBHY** targets "working professionals who are more interested in their professions than in rising through management ranks." **ProducingOSS** describes how contributors gain recognition and influence through their work.

**Discussion:** How do you "advance" in open source if there's no promotion ladder? What does career growth look like in each model? Can open source contributions help your corporate career?

### Question 10: Building Relationships
**HYBHY**'s goal is "building a productive, professional relationship with your manager." **ProducingOSS** focuses on building trust and reputation with distributed collaborators.

**Discussion:** What relationship-building skills transfer between these environments? Which ones don't? Will you use different strategies?

---

## Theme 6: Your Future Workplace

### Question 11: Hybrid Environments
Many modern tech companies adopt open source practices (transparent communication, written culture, distributed teams) while maintaining hierarchies.

**Discussion:** Based on these introductions, what elements of each model do you want in your future workplace? Are there aspects of hierarchies or open source culture you want to avoid?

### Question 12: Preparing for Both
**HYBHY** author was "talented, but high-maintenance" early in his career and "made pretty much every mistake possible when dealing with management." **ProducingOSS** describes the learning curve of open source contribution.

**Discussion:** Which environment do you expect will be easier to navigate? Where do you anticipate making mistakes? How can studying both models prepare you for diverse work environments?

---

## Closing Question (Time Permitting)

### Question 13: The Course Ahead
This semester, we'll alternate between studying hierarchical workplace dynamics (most weeks) and peer-based open source collaboration (Weeks 6, 8, 10).

**Discussion:** What questions do you have about workplace relationships after reading these introductions? What topics are you most curious or concerned about as you approach graduation?

---

## Notes for Instructor

**Pacing Suggestions:**
- Start with Questions 1-2 (authority) to establish the fundamental difference
- Move to Questions 5-6 (communication) or Questions 9-10 (growth) based on student interests
- Save Question 11 (hybrid environments) for near the end - it synthesizes both models
- Use Question 13 as a bridge to next week's topic

**Facilitation Tips:**
- Ask follow-up: "Can you give an example?"
- Connect to their senior projects: "How does this relate to your capstone work?"
- Encourage respectful disagreement: "Does everyone agree with that perspective?"
- Reference specific passages from the introductions when needed

**GitHub Demonstration:**
Reserve final 15 minutes to demo the Git workflow. Students need to understand fork/clone/branch/commit/push/PR by Sunday for repository setup.
